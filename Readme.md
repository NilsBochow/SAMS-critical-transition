## The South American monsoon approaches a critical transition in response to deforestation

This repository contains the supplementary code for the article **The South American monsoon approaches a critical transition in response to deforestation** by Bochow and Boers (2023). 

The code for analysis is located in the folder *Analysis*. Build the Python environment with all required packages via ```conda env create -f environment.yml```. It will create a conda environment called *myclone*.

The model is written in Julia with Python snippets. The model was written using Julia 1.3.0.

For running the model, there are some ```.npy```, ```.nc``` and ```.jld``` files needed. Due to size restrictions on GitHub, they are only available in the archived version of this repository on [Zenodo](https://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8121629).
For questions, problems or comments contact Nils Bochow or open an issue in this repository.
